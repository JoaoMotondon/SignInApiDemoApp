# SignInApiDemoApp

If you need to integrate Google Sign-in into your app, you may find lots of articles online. The most obvious place to start learning is the [official docs](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/). There is also a great (free) course on [Udacity](https://br.udacity.com/course/add-google-sign-in-to-your-android-apps--ud876-5), that although it uses Plus API's that were deprecated in version 9.4 (released on August 2016), it still worth to take a look on it.

Based on the articles mentioned above (and some others I found useful when making my researches), I created a simple app which you can sign-in, sign-out, as well as revoke access to a Google user account. Hope you enjoy it!
